            Ruin Probability Approximation for Bidimensional Brownian Risk Model with 
            Tax</a>
            <p>Abstract: In this paper we derive the exact asymptotics of the ruin probability in the 
                Brownian risk model with tax. We show that the ruin probability decays 
                exponentially with rate given by the solution of an optimization problem. 
                We also derive the asymptotics of the ruin time and the conditional 
                distribution of the ruin time given ruin occurs.</p>
